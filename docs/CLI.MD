# Command-Line Interface

## Internal API

The problem with hooks is that they are configured at application setup time and usually fixed during the whole application lifecycle. It means you would have a to create an application instance for each pipeline youâ€™d like to have, not so simple. This is the reason why krawler can also be used as a command-line utility, where each execution setup the hooks pipeline according to the job to be done. The underlying implementation is managed by the global **run(jobfile, options)** function:
* **jobfile**: a path to a local job file or a jobfile JSON object
* **options**:
  * **proxy**: proxy URL to be used for HTTP requests
  * **proxy-https**: proxy URL to be used for HTTPS requests
  * **user**: user name to be used for proxy
  * **password**: user password to be used for proxy
  * **debug**: debug namespace to output like `krawler*` for all messages or `krawler:hooks*` to only trace hooks messages

This function is responsible of parsing the job definition including all the required parameters to call the underlying services with the relevant hooks configured (see below).

## External API

The jobfile is the sole mandatory argument of the CLI and options are read from the CLI arguments with the same names as in the internal API or using shortcuts like this:
```
krawler --user user_name -p password -P proxy_url path_to_jobfile.json
```

A jobfile could be a JSON or JS file (it will be `require()`) and its structure is the following:
```js
let job = {
  // Options for job executor
  options: {
    workersLimit: 4
  },
  // Store to be used for job output
  store: 'job-store',
  // Common options for all generated tasks
  taskTemplate: {
    // Store to be used for task output
    store: 'job-store',
    id: '<%= jobId %>-<%= taskId %>',
    type: 'xxx',
    options: {
      ...
    }
  },
  // Hooks setup
  hooks: {
    // Tasks service hooks
    tasks: {
      // Hooks to be run after task creation
      after: {
        // Each entry is a hook name and associated options object
        computeSomething: {
          hookOption: ...
        }
      }
    },
    // Jobs service hooks
    jobs: {
      // Hooks to be run before job creation
      before: {
        generateTasks: {
          hookOption: ...
        }
      },
      // Hooks to be run after job creation
      after: {
        generateOutput: {
          hookOption: ...
        }
      }
    }
  },
  // The list of tasks to run if not generated by hooks
  tasks: [
  ...
  ]
}
```

By default hook names are used as JSON object keys so you could not have the same hook appearing twice in your pipeline using this notation. However, you can also use the *named hook syntax* if you want to use the same hook multiple time in your pipeline. In this case the key used in the configuration file can be whatever you want but the associated object value must have a `hook`property containing the name of the hook to be run like this:
```js
tasks: {
  after: {
    readXML: {
    },
    writeTemplateYaml: {
      hook: 'writeTemplate',
      dataPath: 'result.data.WMS_Capabilities.Capability.Layer',
      templateFile: 'mapproxy-template.yaml'
    },
    writeTemplateHtml: {
      hook: 'writeTemplate',
      dataPath: 'result.data.WMS_Capabilities.Capability.Layer',
      templateFile: 'leaflet-template.html'
    }
  }
}
```

By default all hooks are run in sequence, if at given step of your pipeline you want a parallel execution of some you can use the reserved hook name `parallel` and give the hooks to be run in parallel as an array of items each containing the hook name as a `hook` property and its options as other properties:
```js
tasks: {
  after: {
    readXML: {
    },
    parallel: [
      {
        hook: 'writeTemplate',
        templateFile: 'mapproxy-template.yaml'
      },
      {
        hook: 'writeTemplate',
        templateFile: 'leaflet-template.html'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
